This is a standard game of Connect Four, where you drop one piece into
one of seven columns and try to have four in a row.  The computer player
is set to always go for a winning move or block your winning move if able,
and will otherwise will find all of the spots that it could maximize its
own chains of pieces, and minimize the opponent's.  It also recognizes
when a dead-end has occured, i.e. a piece on the bottom right corner
cannot be a part of a horizontal winning chain when the opponent plays
a piece two spaces away from it.

The computer play is, however, beatable.
