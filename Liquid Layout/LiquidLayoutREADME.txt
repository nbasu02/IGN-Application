Why use a liquid layout?

In general, a liquid layout would be used when the web page in question
plans to have a lot of text and content.  This would make it easier for the
reader, especially if the content is a reference, because they can still
read all of the text without needing to scroll left and right when they shrink
the browser's window size.
